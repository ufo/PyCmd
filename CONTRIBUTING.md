To avoid duplicate/overlapping/conflicting work, it is recommended to submit pull requests only if:
  1. you are currently the assignee of a corresponding issue **OR**
  2. you have the project owner's acknowledgement for working on a given file/topic
  3. 
Sending contributions without honoring the above rule is acceptable but might result in the patch 
being rejected (if the task was already being tackled by someone else).
